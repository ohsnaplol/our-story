Scene 1: Waking Up

Bedroom
A loud crash shakes the ship, startling you awake. The noise echoes for a few moments before an all-consuming silence settles in the room. After a few seconds, the glow of emergency lights bathes your sleeping quarters in a dull red light. What in the world has happened? Perhaps you should look around to find the cause of this...

Actions: 
    Look/Look around 
        General - "The emergency lights make it hard to see, but you know the details of this room like the back of your hand. Your small cot seems at first glance spartan, but is actually quite comfortable. A tote full of your engineering tools sits in the corner where you always toss it after a long day repairing the various sections of the ship. A door to your left leads to the bathroom, dark and without an emergency light. A door to your right leads to the hallway."

        Self - Disheveled, the circles under your eyes speak to the disturbance of your much needed sleep. Maybe you'll get the chance to grab some caffeine before you fix whatever broke...

        Door_hall - A heavy hyper-alloy bulkhead. Closes by running current run though it which makes it heavier, so fortunately you'll still be able to open these without a charge-key. This one leads to the Hallway

        Door_bathroom - A simple hinged door. With the power out, your bathroom is pitch-dark, but you know where the toilet is if needed.

        Bed - A simple cot, but it's more comfortable than it looks. The sheets are tossed about thanks to your rather rude awakening...
                [Alt] - Your neatly made bed looks so welcoming


    
    Open - 
        Toolbag - You see a collection of your finest tools. Looks like you forgot to charge the Charge-key for the doors, but there should be power cells around here somewhere...
            Multi-bit driver
            Charge-key [depleted]
            Adjustable wrench
            Welder's Torch

        Door_bathroom - It's dark, but you quickly take care of business. 
                [Alt] - There's no need to use the bathroom now
        
        Door_hall - You lift the door easily and can now enter the hallway

    Interact - 
        Bed - Make bed | Grab sheet | Go to bed
        Tools - Picked up <Tool> and are ready to use it
            [Alt] The <Tool> is out of power. If you can find a charged cell it should work
            [Alt] You put away the <Tool>.
